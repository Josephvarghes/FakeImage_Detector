Fake Image Detection
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a deepfake image detection system using neural networks and TensorFlow. The system is capable of identifying whether an image is real or fake by analyzing various features extracted from the image data. The project leverages machine learning techniques to build a robust model that can distinguish between genuine and manipulated images.
